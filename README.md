# WebStudio website

[Live Web Page](https://mkamilamin.github.io/WebStudio-website/)

The WebStudio website is an example website made with pure HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript.

It is responsive using the Mobile-First building model. It has fully optimized images and and working links and buttons.

The motivation behind this project was to garner expierience and a deeper understanding of how pure HTML and CSS work.
