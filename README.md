# WebStudio website

[Live Web Page](https://mkamilamin.github.io/WebStudio-website/)

WebStusio is a static website crafted with pure HTML and CSS, and enhanced with a few JavaScript functions. This project is designed to showcase clean and correct HTML and CSS coding practices and responsive, mobile-first design principles.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design**: Built with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
-   **Minimalistic UI**: Clean and simple design with non-distracting transitions to maintain focus on content.
-   **Interactive Elements**: Buttons that open and close a modal and a slide-in mobile menu.
-   **Optimized Images**: All images are compressed using the WebP format for faster loading and better performance.
-   **Structured File Organization**: Thoughtfully organized folders and files for easy navigation and maintenance.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Project**: Clone or download the project files from this repository.
2. **Open the HTML File**: No installation is required. Simply open the main HTML file in your browser to view the website.

## Usage

While there are no active, interactive features like form submissions, you can explore the structured HTML and CSS code as well as the JavaScript used for simple functionality such as:

-   **Modals**: Click the designated button to open and close modal windows.
-   **Mobile Menu**: The mobile menu toggles with a smooth transition from the right side of the screen.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS**
-   **JavaScript** (for basic functionality only)

I use the [EMOJI-LOG](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log) standard by Ahmad Awais for commit messages. Each commit message starts with an emoji to indicate the type of change:

-   `üì¶ NEW:` Add new functionality
-   `üëå IMPROVE:` Code edits without fixing bugs or adding new features
-   `üêõ FIX:` Bug fixes
-   `üìñ DOC:` Anything documentation related
-   `üöÄ RELEASE:` Release a new version
-   `ü§ñ TEST:` Testing related commits
-   `‚ÄºÔ∏è BREAKING:` Change that breaks previous versions

This makes commit history clear and easy to follow.
